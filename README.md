Weekly Codility Practice - Compulsory
Congratulations on making it this far!Party Popper on Apple 

Hereby introducing weekly codility practice geared towards preparing you for the final codility test to be done towards the end of the program, as well as for future tech interviews. This will entail small, simplified programming challenges that can help you build and reinforce your coding skills, with support from the TMs. They may seem trivial, but they are an essential part of your learning process.
Here are a few reasons why they are important:
Firstly, practicing toy problems can help you gain confidence in your abilities. When you solve a problem, no matter how small it may be, it can be a great boost to your self-esteem. This confidence will help you tackle more challenging problems later on.

Secondly, toy problems can help you identify and fix errors more efficiently. The small nature of these problems makes it easier to pinpoint errors in your code, and you can quickly test and refine your solution until it works perfectly.

Thirdly, practicing toy problems can help you develop your problem-solving skills. By working through these challenges, you can learn how to approach problems logically, break them down into smaller components, and find creative solutions.

Finally, toy problems can help you build a strong foundation of programming knowledge. As you practice more and more, you'll start to see patterns and commonalities in different types of problems. This foundation will help you in the long run as you tackle more complex programming challenges.

We encourage you to make practicing toy problems a regular part of your coding routine and block some time on your calendar once every week to attempt the ones set out for you on canvas. Not only will it improve your skills, but it can also be a rewarding experience, especially for those of you that will be looking for employment opportunities after this. Happy Coding:)

 

Instructions
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

2. Write down the solution in a file

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for review.

5. Ensure your repository has a well-written README, detailing the steps taken to break down the problem and come up with a solution (Read me Sample.)

 

Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)
Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.

Example: 

(5, 4)   ---> "5 is greater than 4"

(-4, -7) ---> "-4 is greater than -7"

(2, 2)   ---> "2 is equal to 2"
There is only one problem...

You cannot use if statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator ? 

In fact, the word if and the character ? are not allowed in your code.

 

Challenge2: Ordered Count of Characters(Toy Problem)
Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of arrays) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Example:

"abracadabra" ---->  [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]]

"Code Wars -----> [['C', 1], ['o', 1], ['d', 1], ['e', 1], [' ', 1], ['W', 1], ['a', 1], ['r', 1], ['s', 1]]

"233312", ------> [['2', 2], ['3', 3], ['1', 1 ]]
